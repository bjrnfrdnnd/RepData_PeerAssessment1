Repo for assignment of Week 02 of the coursera course "Reproducible Research".
The actual data analysis is performed in the file [Script.Rmd](Script.Rmd). The output of the command

    knit2html("Script.Rmd",force_v1=TRUE)

are the files

* [Script.md](Script.md)
* [Script.html](Script.html)

which are also present in this directory. The most convenient way of reading the analysis is by using [Sript.md](Script.md). There are also some figures  in the [figures](figures) subdirectory which are linked to [Sript.md](Script.md).
