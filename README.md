Repo for assignment of Week 02 of the coursera course "Reproducible Research".
The actual data analysis is performed in the file [PA1_template.Rmd](PA1_template.Rmd). The output of the command

    knit2html("PA1_template.Rmd",force_v1=TRUE)

are the files

* [PA1_template.md](PA1_template.md)
* [PA1_template.html](PA1_template.html)

which are also present in this directory. The most convenient way of reading the analysis is by using [PA1_template.md](PA1_template.md). There are also some figures  in the [figures](figures) subdirectory which are linked to [PA1_template.md](PA1_template.md).
